CRUD capabilities are possible and managed via the Redux store. React-router is used to manage the routing between the list of user and the form page to add a new user. These can be selected in the menu bar. Material UI is utilized for styling. The server at the root is used to handle the json-server settings and loads a static page, the client is loaded immediately after.
